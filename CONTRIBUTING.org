* Contributing to Chorebot
** Setting up your development environment

You'll need to be able to compile Haskell code and also download and
compile all of Chorebot's dependencies.

The easiest way to get started is to use Stack:

https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install

In the Chorebot repository, you can then run:

#+begin_src sh
stack build
#+end_src

It will take a while the first time you do this, to download and
compile all of Chorebot's dependencies.

** Making a change

Easy: use Github to fork the Chorebot repository, make a new branch,
push up your changes, and open a pull request. Make sure it compiles
first!
