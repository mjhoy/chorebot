A simple bot that divvies up chores and sends out emails.

** Defining chores

A list of chores is defined in chores.txt. A chore is defined in a
special format, separated by a newline from other chores. The basic
format is:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[Chore title]: [Interval] [Difficulty]
[Description]
#+END_SRC

For instance,

#+BEGIN_SRC
Third floor bathroom: 1 Hard
Clean and scrub tub/shower/sink to remove grime, clean toilet bowl,
sweep and mop floors, clean countertop, clean mirror, change towels
and floor mats, replenish TP and soap as needed.

Water Plants: 1 Easy

Sweep/mop kitchen: 1 Medium
For the first week of the month, mop; otherwise sweep.
#+END_SRC

The description is optional.

The interval is the number of weeks until a chore is repeated. "1"
means the chore is repeated every week, "2" every other week, and so
on.

The difficulty is the word "Hard", "Medium" or "Easy". The exact
calculation may be adjusted, but it should be something like: one hard
chore is worth slightly less than two medium chores, and one medium
chore is worth two easy chores.
